PFWA
====

PFWA is a PHP Framework for Web Application using Twig and php-activerecord

:warning: Do not use it !
=========================

« PFWA » is a textbook case, conceived during a period of learning and is my first experience of creating framework where Twig and php-activerecord were magic to me.

I learned a lot to try to do things in the rules of the art, but I think that this project is not finished and is certainly not usable in reality.

You who pass by here, consider this repository as a way to understand what a web application framework, a textbook case, an example not to do or a project to show your trainee, but not as a mature library .

Enjoy !
